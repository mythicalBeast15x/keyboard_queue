# keyboard_queue
The Keyboard Queue is for copying and pasting multiple things at once. Just copy the texts that you want, and hitting paste will paste the first thing you copied then move on to the next
This only works on Windows
To use, download AutoHotKey, so that the ahk scripts can run
download the ahk scripts and the python script
Then run the copy and paste scripts
*make sure that the python script is in the AppData\Roaming folder*
